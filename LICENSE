                            Preamble

The GNU Affero General Public License is a free, copyleft license for
software and other kinds of works, specifically designed to ensure
proper cooperation for the benefit of all.  For example, the
holders of this License grant you the right to use, modify, and
distribute the Program, and ensure that any derivative works which
you make available to the public is also available to those
holders under the terms and conditions of this License.  To the
extent permitted by applicable law, you may also, at your option,
treat any or all works not covered by this License as though they were
not part of this License, and distribute them separately.  When you
do so, the Program must be accompanied by a prominent notice
stating that the Program and any derivative works are licensed under the
terms of this License, and informing them that you provide these
terms.  You may charge any price or no fee for such copies, and
you may at your option offer warranty protection in exchange for a fee.

THE FOLLOWING TERMS AND CONDITIONS APPLY TO THIS PROGRAM AND TO
ANY DERIVATIVE WORK OF YOURS UNLESS REQUIRED BY APPLICABLE
LAW OR AGREED TO IN WRITING.  Terms and conditions for
copying, distribution and modification follow the GNU Affero General Public

2. Basic Permissions.

All rights granted under this License are granted for the term of
copyright on the Program, and are irrevocable except as stated in
Sections 3, 4, 5, 6, 7, 8, and 9.

a) Redistribution

You may reproduce and distribute copies of the Program or
Derivative Works, in Source or Object form, provided that you
conspicuously convey to recipients the notice that they are receiving the
Program under the License, and conspicuously and appropriately publish on
each copy an appropriate copyright notice; keep intact all notices
that refer to this License and to the absence of any warranty; and
conspicuously provide all recipients with a copy of the License along
with the Program, including any System Library that is distributed with it.

You may charge any price or no fee for copies that you distribute
and you are at your option to offer warranty or support in exchange
for a fee.

b) Conveying and Distributing Source and Object Forms

You may convey a work based on the Program in Source or Object form
under the terms of this License, provided that you also meet the
following conditions for Source form:

1) The work must carry prominent notices stating that it is a
Derivative Work of the Program and that it is available under the
License, and that it includes the License.

2) The work must carry prominent notices stating that it is a User
Product of the Program, and that it includes the License, and that the
License is included with a prominent notice stating that it is a User
Product of the work.

3) You may charge a price or no fee for copies of the work you
convey, and you may at your option offer warranty or support in exchange

License, provided that the copy of the work is distributed under the
License, the copy conspicuously displays a valid copyright notice,
includes a notice stating that it is a User Product of the work, and
includes a notice stating that the License applies to the work.

3. Permissions of the Licensor.

The Licensor grants you the following rights in addition to the rights
granted by Section 2:

a) Copyright Grant

Subject to the terms and conditions of this License, the Licensor
grants you a non-exclusive, worldwide, royalty-free license to use,
reproduce, modify, and display the Program, and to distribute
Derivative Works based on the Program, and to license any such Derivative
Works to third parties.

b) Patent Grant

The Licensor grants you a non-exclusive, worldwide, royalty-free patent
license under the Licensor's patents essential to the Program to make, use,
sell, offer for sale, import, and otherwise transfer the Program and any
Derivative Works thereof, and to sublicense and to authorize others to do
the same, subject to the following conditions:

1) Any sublicense shall include the License grant to the third party,
and the third party shall have the same rights to use the Program and
Derivative Works as the recipient, including but not limited to the rights
under Section 2 and the right to sublicense any Derivative Works of
the Program, subject to the condition that the third party includes the
License grant to the first party.

2) The license grant in the third party's sublicense must include an
additional grant to the third party to the extent that the third party
grants a license to its third-party licensors for the Program, subject to the
conditions of Section 3.  For example, if a third party receives a copy of the
Program under this License, and then a third party receives a copy of the
Program from the third party under a sublicense that includes the right to
sublicense to third parties, then the first third party's sublicense must
include a right to sublicense to the third parties from the first third party.

3) If the Program includes a System Library that is covered by this
License, and if the Program is modified to include the System Library
in a combined work that is distributed under this License, and if the
System Library is separately distributed under this License, then each party
that contributes the System Library must ensure that the System Library,
and any Derivative Works of the System Library that are distributed
under this License, include a license grant to the third party to use the
Program and Derivative Works of the Program, subject to the conditions of
Section 3.

4) Sublicensing

You may sublicense Derivative Works of the Program to third parties
under the terms of this License, provided that you also meet the
following conditions for sublicensing:

1) You must prominently display the License on each copy of the Derivative
Work and each System Library that you sublicense or distribute, and on each
copy of the Program that you sublicense or distribute.

2) You must provide all recipients with a copy of the License along with the
Derivative Work or System Library, and conspicuously display the License
on each copy of the Program that is included in the Derivative Work or
System Library.

3) You must ensure that any Derivative Work or System Library that you
sublicense or distribute includes a notice stating that it is a Derivative
Work of the Program, that it includes the License, and that the License
applies to the Derivative Work or System Library.

5. Patent Grant Subject to Additional Terms

The patent grant in Section 2(b) is subject to the following
additional conditions:

1) The patent grant does not include any patent licenses that the Licensor
receives from third parties, whether by cross-license, patent pooling, or
other means.

2) The patent grant does not include any patents that the Licensor receives from
third parties in exchange for the third party's license to the Program,
unless the Licensor and the third party agree to include the patent licenses
from the third party in the patent grant.

3) The patent grant does not include any patents that are essential to the
Program for the Program to function as a whole, unless the Licensor and the
third party agree to include the patent licenses from the third party in
the patent grant.

6. License Notices

a) Copyright Notice

You must include a prominent notice on each copy of the Program and
each Derivative Work and System Library that states:

"This work is part of Question Engine OS."

b) License Notice

You must include a prominent notice on each copy of the Program and
each Derivative Work and System Library that states:

"This program is free software: you can redistribute it and/or modify
it under the terms of the GNU Affero General Public License version 3 as
published by the Free Software Foundation."

If the Program includes a notice stating that it is a User Product,
the notice must also include the License.

7. Disclaimer of Warranty

UNLESS REQUIRED BY APPLICABLE LAW, THE LICENSOR PROVIDES THE PROGRAM
"AS IS" WITHOUT WARRANTY OF ANY KIND, EITHER EXPRESSED OR IMPLIED,
INCLUDING, WITHOUT LIMITATION, THE IMPLIED WARRANTIES OF
MERCHANTABILITY, FITNESS FOR A PARTICULAR PURPOSE, AND NONINFRINGEMENT.  IN NO
EVENT SHALL THE LICENSOR BE LIABLE FOR ANY DIRECT, INDIRECT, INCIDENTAL,
SPECIAL, EXEMPLARY, OR CONSEQUENTIAL DAMAGES (INCLUDING, BUT NOT LIMITED
TO, PROCUREMENT OF SUBSTITUTE GOODS OR SERVICES; LOSS OF USE, DATA, OR
PROFITS; OR BUSINESS INTERRUPTION) HOWEVER CAUSED AND ON ANY THEORY
OF LIABILITY, WHETHER IN CONTRACT, STRICT LIABILITY, OR TORT (INCLUDING
NEGLIGENCE OR OTHERWISE) ARISING IN ANY WAY OUT OF THE USE OF THIS
PROGRAM, EVEN IF ADVISED OF THE POSSIBILITY OF SUCH DAMAGE.

8. Termination

You may terminate the exercise of rights under this License at any time,
and terminate all grants and permissions under this License, except that
any rights that you have received as a result of exercising or being
granted the rights under this License shall survive termination.

9. Limitation of Liability

EXCEPT AS REQUIRED BY APPLICABLE LAW, IN NO EVENT SHALL THE LICENSOR
BE LIABLE TO YOU FOR DAMAGES, INCLUDING ANY DIRECT, INDIRECT, INCIDENTAL,
SPECIAL, EXEMPLARY, OR CONSEQUENTIAL DAMAGES (INCLUDING, BUT NOT LIMITED TO,
PROCUREMENT OF SUBSTITUTE GOODS OR SERVICES; LOSS OF USE, DATA, OR
PROFITS; OR BUSINESS INTERRUPTION) HOWEVER CAUSED AND ON ANY THEORY
OF LIABILITY, WHETHER IN CONTRACT, STRICT LIABILITY, OR TORT (INCLUDING
NEGLIGENCE OR OTHERWISE) ARISING IN ANY WAY OUT OF THE USE OF THIS
PROGRAM, EVEN IF ADVISED OF THE POSSIBILITY OF SUCH DAMAGE.

10. Provision of Resources

You must not attempt to circumvent the terms of this License by providing
resources in ways other than as expressly permitted.  For example, you
may not provide the resources in such a way that requires the recipient to
exercise rights under the License that the recipient may not exercise.

11. Versions of the License

The Free Software Foundation may publish revised and/or new versions of the
GNU Affero General Public License from time to time.  Such new versions
will be similar in spirit to the present version, but may differ in detail
to address new problems or concerns.

Each version is given a distinguishing version number.  If the Program
specifies a version number of the License which applies to it and "any later
version", you have the option of following the terms and conditions of that
version or of any later version published by the Free Software Foundation.
If the Program specifies that a proxy can decide which future versions
of the GNU Affero General Public License can be used, that proxy's public
statement of acceptance of a version permanently authorizes you to choose that
version for the Program.

Later license versions may give you additional or different
permissions.  However, no additional obligations are imposed on any author or
copyright holder as a result of your choosing to follow a later version.

12. No Warranty

THE PROGRAM IS DISTRIBUTED "AS IS", WITHOUT WARRANTY OF ANY KIND,
EITHER EXPRESSED OR IMPLIED, INCLUDING, WITHOUT LIMITATION, THE IMPLIED
WARRANTIES OF MERCHANTABILITY, FITNESS FOR A PARTICULAR PURPOSE, AND
NONINFRINGEMENT.  IN NO EVENT SHALL THE AUTHORS OR COPYRIGHT HOLDERS BE
LIABLE FOR ANY CLAIM, DAMAGES OR OTHER LIABILITY, WHETHER IN AN ACTION
OF CONTRACT, TORT OR OTHERWISE, ARISING FROM, OUT OF OR IN CONNECTION
WITH THE PROGRAM OR THE USE OR OTHER DEALINGS IN THE PROGRAM.

13. Accepting Warranty or Additional Liability

While redistributing the Program or Derivative Works thereof, you may
choose to offer, and charge a fee for, acceptance of support,
warranty, indemnity, or other liability obligations and/or rights consistent
with this License.  However, in accepting such obligations, you may act
only on your own behalf and on your sole responsibility, not on behalf
of any other party, and only if you agree to indemnify, defend, and hold each
other party harmless for any liability incurred by, or claims asserted against,
such other party by reason of your accepting any such warranty or additional
liability.

14. Accepting the License

By exercising any rights granted to you under the License, you indicate
your acceptance of the License to do so, and you accept all its terms and
conditions.
